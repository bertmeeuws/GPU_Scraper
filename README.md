## Introduction
Due to the current high demand for graphics cards and increased prices, it can be difficult to find a reasonably priced GPU. To help users find the best deals, we have developed a GPU Scraper that fetches product data from various websites, comparing prices so you can grab the best deal available.
## Features
- Scrapes multiple websites for GPU prices and availability.
- Allows users to filter GPUs based on specific criteria (price range, brand, model, etc.).
- Automatically updates prices at regular intervals.
- Sends notifications when prices drop or new deals become available.
- Easy to use interface for comparing and filtering GPUs.
## Usage
1. Open the application and navigate to the main page.
2. Select your desired filters (price range, brand, model, etc.) and click 'Search'.
3. Browse through the list of available GPUs and compare prices.
4. Click on a product to view more details and visit the respective website to complete the purchase.
5. Adjust the notification settings to receive alerts when a new deal is available or when a price drops.
